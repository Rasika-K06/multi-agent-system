## Deploy to Hugging Face Space

Your local version is working perfectly! To update the live Space:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the repo directory
cd C:\Users\rasik\multi-agent-system

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Fix: Improve controller routing, rationale display, and Windows compatibility"

# Push to HF Space
git push
```

The Space will automatically rebuild with your changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use?
```bash
# Find and kill process on port 7860
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 7860).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Need to Reinstall Dependencies?
```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### Virtual Environment Not Activated?
Don't worry! The `run.bat` script automatically uses the correct Python from `.venv\Scripts\`

## Recording Your Demo

### Setup (5 minutes before recording)
1. âœ… Start the server: `.\run.bat`
2. âœ… Wait for "Application started" message
3. âœ… Open http://localhost:7860 in browser
4. âœ… Test all 3 queries to warm up the system
5. âœ… Close unnecessary browser tabs
6. âœ… Set up screen recording (Windows Game Bar: Win+G)

### Recording Flow (Under 5 minutes)
1. **Intro (30 sec):** Introduce yourself and the project
2. **Architecture (30 sec):** Show report diagram briefly
3. **Live Demo (3 min):** 
   - Query 1: Solar Industries products
   - Query 2: Academic papers
   - Query 3: Technology trends (highlight multi-agent!)
4. **Code Glimpse (1 min):** Show controller.py highlighting routing logic
5. **Conclusion (30 sec):** Summarize capabilities and business value

### Key Points to Emphasize
- âœ… **Hybrid Approach:** Rule-based + AI for optimal performance
- âœ… **Domain Expertise:** Solar Industries-specific knowledge
- âœ… **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Intelligent routing and synthesis
- âœ… **Production-Ready:** Error handling, logging, observability
- âœ… **Business Value:** Faster queries, lower costs, better accuracy
